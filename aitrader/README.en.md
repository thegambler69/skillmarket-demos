# GMGN AI Trader (local)

English · **[中文](README.md)**

Dashboard screens, the human trades: deterministic rules cast a wide net → scoring cuts hard → the LLM only explains the survivors → you press one-click buy.
A separate position escape monitor flags rug signals and prompts a one-click exit. The LLM never touches risk control or the escape path.

## What it does

- **Screening pipeline**: `market trending` pulls trending candidates (rows already carry due-diligence fields, zero extra cli) → **deterministic hard gates** avoid landmines (honeypot / buy-sell tax / rug / bundler / dev holding / top-10 concentration) + consensus (smart-money / KOL counts) → **trend-momentum scoring & ranking** (5m/1h momentum · buy pressure · turnover · consensus · safety · dev) → **the LLM only explains the survivors** (verdict / conviction / crowdedness / thesis) → produces candidates with code-computed sizing.
- **Wallet Evaluation tab**: a standalone tab next to "Token Screening" — enter any wallet address to break down its trading style. Core insight: **a great track record doesn't mean you can copy it** — it splits "is this trader actually good" from "how much of it can you actually capture" into two separate scores: a **Track-Record Score** (driven by stop-loss discipline + profit-factor/ROI/win-rate/sample size — a low win rate can still score high) and a **Copy-Tradeability Score** (entry market cap / per-trade profit / hold time vs. your latency / execution feasibility / edge type); 14 **trading-style tags** (Dev / Bot / Flash-flipper / Sniper / Diamond hands / Whale / True pro / Bag-holder / Degen gambler / Slow-and-steady / High win-rate / Quick-draw / Obscure hunter / Regular trader — rules detailed in [WALLET_TAB_NOTES.md](WALLET_TAB_NOTES.md)); once a wallet is classified as a token dev (self-launched tokens > half of traded tokens) it reuses the screening side's **Dev reputation** score, and both trading scores are automatically discounted (entry timing / win rate mean nothing on tokens you launched yourself); a **copy-trade backtest simulator** with latency/slippage/gas sliders mirrors the backend formula client-side for instant recompute. The whole page is bilingual (EN/CN, toggled top-right); scoring is deterministic rules — **the LLM never participates**.
- **Dev evaluation dimension**: for the top-ranked candidates it queries the dev wallet's launch history (`portfolio created-tokens`) + a per-token security scan of the latest N launches (`token security`), and computes a dev reputation score — **driven by per-token survival rate** minus penalties for stuck-inner-curve spam / launching unsafe tokens (mintable / freeze-not-renounced / not-open-source / honeypot) / logo-reskin re-launches / having exited the token. It's both a **ranking sub-score** and a **filter gate**: serial-rug token factories and reskin devs are cut outright (not merely down-ranked). The frontend has a `DEV Score` column + a "Dev reputation card" on row click (launch history / rug rate / survival / reskin / security risks).
- **Position escape monitor**: a safety snapshot is taken at entry and diff-rechecked each cycle (honeypot / renounce / top-10 concentration); once it degrades past the threshold an "exit now" prompt pops. Strictly separated from screening/risk-control — the LLM never touches the escape path.
- **One-click buy / sell (human-in-the-loop)**: candidates that clear every gate land in "awaiting your decision"; a trade happens only when you click. A buy polls to confirm the real fill — on failure it records no position and does not lie; the fill carries a tx hash.
- **LIVE / SHADOW**: one-click toggle (with second confirmation) between SHADOW (paper, default safe state, log-only) and LIVE (real funds, irreversible); the `LIVE_TRADING_DISABLED` master switch at the top of `app.py` can seal off all on-chain writes instantly.
- **Multi-chain**: SOL / BSC / Base / ETH / Robinhood switched per-request, with per-chain adapter cache + short-cached trending and per-chain command/buy-unit memory; multiple tabs each hold their own chain without interfering.
- **Persistence / isolation**: positions persist to disk (`positions.json`, survive restart) + per-chain isolation; every decision is appended to `trade_decisions.jsonl` (SCREEN/FILTER/BUY/SELL/UNMONITOR).
- **Runs without a key**: the built-in `MockGMGN` adapter synthesizes isomorphic data, so you can fully demo/integrate without gmgn-cli or a key; with a key configured it switches to real market data on startup.
- **GitHub Pages demo mode**: off localhost and with the backend unreachable, the frontend auto-enters DEMO mode (sample data + demo banner, zero API, zero key, cannot place orders).

Credentials are not in the project; they are written to your machine at runtime: `~/.config/gmgn/.env` (chmod 600).

## Setup (one-time)
1. Python 3.10+
2. Only needed for LIVE / real market data: install `gmgn-cli` (verified against **1.5.2**; the 1.0.x interface is no longer compatible; the robinhood chain needs ≥1.5.1)
   ```bash
   npm install -g gmgn-cli@1.5.2
   ```
3. Only needed for LIVE / real market data: go to gmgn.ai/ai and apply for an API Key using your own Ed25519 public key + egress IP
   (the key is bound to the IP whitelist you applied with — each user uses their own, they cannot be shared)

You can run without gmgn-cli and without a key — by default it uses the built-in `MockGMGN` adapter.

4. Only needed if you edit the frontend: enable the git hook (auto-syncs `static/index.html` to `docs/` on commit)
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks
   ```
   The hook script ships with the repo, but this `git config` line is local config and does not travel with a clone, so **each person must run it once after cloning**. If you don't, editing `static/` won't update `docs/`, and the GitHub Pages demo will silently stay on the old version.

## Run
```bash
# from the skillmarket-demos repo root
cd aitrader
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

> On startup the backend reads the key from `~/.config/gmgn/.env`; if a key is present it automatically switches to real data — no need to enter it in the frontend.

## Usage
- Default Mock adapter + SHADOW mode: **runs without a key** (for integration testing).
- With a key configured it connects to real market data automatically; the top-right gear lets you edit the trending command / poll interval per chain.
- Top-right CHAIN dropdown switches **SOL / BSC / Base / ETH / Robinhood** (each tab keeps its own chain via sessionStorage, so multiple tabs don't interfere); the top-right **MODE icon toggles LIVE/SHADOW on click**.
- Candidates that pass all gates land in "awaiting your decision"; a trade happens only when you click "one-click buy".
- Positions appear in the escape monitor on the right; once they degrade past the threshold (severity ≥ 70) an "exit now" prompt pops up.

## LIVE / SHADOW (important)
- **SHADOW (paper trading) = the default safe state**: buy/sell only writes to the log + positions.json, and **sends no on-chain transactions**.
- **LIVE = real trades, real funds, irreversible**: requires ① clicking the **MODE icon top-right to switch to LIVE** (with a second confirmation) + ② `GMGN_PRIVATE_KEY` configured in `~/.config/gmgn/.env` (an Ed25519 PEM signing key, not a wallet private key).
- `LIVE_TRADING_DISABLED` at the top of `app.py`: **currently `True` (locked)**. The app forces SHADOW and never calls `swap()`, even if the UI requests LIVE.
- It's still **human-in-the-loop**: a trade happens only when you click "one-click buy/sell"; after a backend restart the mode reverts to SHADOW (LIVE is not persisted) and must be switched again.
- A buy **polls to confirm the real fill**: on failure it records no position and does not lie; the fill prompt includes the tx hash — checking it on a block explorer yourself is the most reliable.
- ⚠️ Real trading is **currently only fully verified on Solana**; for EVM see "Known limitations" below.

## GitHub Pages demo
When not on localhost (e.g. github.io) and the backend is unreachable, the frontend **automatically enters DEMO mode**: it shows sample data, displays a demo banner, sends no fetches, and cannot place orders (purely static, zero API, zero key); the Wallet Evaluation tab likewise auto-fills a fake address and a fake result when switched to DEMO, purely to showcase the page layout — it does not represent any real data.
Deploy: Settings → Pages → `main` branch `/docs`. After editing the frontend, the pre-commit hook auto-syncs each demo's `<demo>/static/index.html` to `docs/<demo>/index.html` (for this demo, that's `docs/aitrader/index.html`).

## Security
- The backend binds only to 127.0.0.1 — never change it to 0.0.0.0 or expose it to the public internet.
- Keys are sent only to the local backend, written to a local .env, and never stored in the browser.

## Known limitations / TODO

**⚠ Auto sell strategy at buy time — not yet implemented**
The "exit plan (hard stop-loss / TP ladder / trailing stop)" shown in the frontend buy dialog is **display text only** for now (`exit_plan()`). The `swap()` that `do_buy` calls for the real order **does not pass `--condition-orders`, so no take-profit/stop-loss orders are actually placed**. After buying you can only watch manually + rely on the escape monitor + exit by hand. TODO: assemble `--condition-orders` from the TP/SL ladder and submit it together with the swap (parameter semantics / per-chain support need to be verified against the real interface).

**⚠ Wallet Evaluation — known data gap in Dev detection on the Base chain**
The `created_token_count` field used to decide "is this a token dev" can still come back as 0 on Base for wallets confirmed to have launched tokens (a GMGN backend data issue, not a bug in this project's code), which may misclassify a Base-chain dev as a regular trader and hide the Dev reputation card; sol/bsc/eth show no such issue. Score thresholds/weights are likewise heuristic placeholders, not calibrated against real PnL. See [WALLET_TAB_NOTES.md](WALLET_TAB_NOTES.md) for details.

**⚠ EVM chain screening looks buggy — only Solana is fully working today**
- **Solana**: the full path — screen / buy / sell / position monitoring — is verified (including a real signed `order quote`).
- **EVM (BSC / Base / ETH / Robinhood)**: the plumbing is wired (adapter / native token `0x0` / 18-decimal precision / wallet resolution / bsc's default fourmeme platform command all aligned to the authoritative table), but **screening results look wrong/incomplete and are not fully verified, and buy/sell has not been live-tested per chain**. Suspected issues: whether EVM `market trending` row fields match the Solana assumptions in `FeatureExtractor.build_from_row` / `hard_gates` (`is_honeypot`/`renounced_mint`/`bundler_rate`/`buys/sells` etc. may be named differently or be missing → mis-firing the rug gate / momentum scoring); whether base/eth/robinhood need a per-chain launchpad platform. **For now EVM is recommended for read-only browsing only; before going live, investigate and verify with small amounts chain by chain.**
- **Robinhood** (added in gmgn-cli 1.5.1): `market trending` / `portfolio stats` / `portfolio activity` / `portfolio created-tokens` / `token security` / `token info` have each been live-tested against the real API and match the bsc/base/eth field shapes; the `0x0` native-token address was confirmed to resolve to ETH (18 decimals). However `cooking create` (token launch) and `track kol` / `track smartmoney` / `market signal` **are explicitly documented as unsupported for robinhood** in gmgn-cli's own README (this app doesn't call those commands, so it's unaffected); `swap` / `order` / `gas-price` accept `--chain robinhood`, but the official README's Chain Currencies table doesn't list a currency for it — **verify a real quote with a small amount before going live**.

**Pending integration (marked in code, see SPEC §11)**
- `LLMJudge.judge`: currently a momentum-heuristic placeholder; in production swap in a real LLM (fed the sanitized `symbol_safe` + numeric features, never the raw token name).
- `priority_score`: currently a deterministic momentum weighting (the doc's "ML ranking"); can be swapped for a lightweight model.
- Feedback flywheel: trade_decisions.jsonl is already the raw material; once backfilled with realized PnL it can tune the CFG thresholds (currently write-only).
